This plugin works from 1.7.9 and upwards

Any plugin that prevents teleporting while in combat or uses scoreboard features such as teams and prefixes may conflict with Skywars

Using mysql is highly recommended as it increases the performance and protects you from some issues

If you want any holographic feature, you will need to install HolographicDisplays

If you want to use the Holographic Stats feature, you will need to install HolographicDisplays along ProtocolLib
